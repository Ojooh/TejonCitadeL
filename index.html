            <div class="answers">
                <p>Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and a completely digital money.
                    It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no
                    central authority or middlemen. From a user perspective, Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for
                    the Internet. Bitcoin can also be seen as the most prominent triple entry bookkeeping system in
                    existence. </p>

                Who created bitcoin?
            </label>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>Bitcoin is the first implementation of a concept called "cryptocurrency", which was first described
                    in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list, suggesting the idea of a new form of money that
                    uses cryptography to control its creation and transactions, rather than a central authority.
                    The first Bitcoin specification and proof of concept was published in 2009 in a cryptography
                    mailing list by Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi left the project in late 2010 without revealing much
                    about himself. The community has since grown exponentially with many developers working on Bitcoin.

                Who controls the Bitcoin network?

            <div class="answers">
                <p>Nobody owns the Bitcoin network much like no one owns the technology behind email. Bitcoin is
                    controlled
                    by all Bitcoin users around the world. While developers are improving the software, they can't force
                    a
                    change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they
                    use.
                    In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same
                    rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users. Therefore, all
                    users and developers have a strong incentive to protect this consensus. </p>

            <div class="answers">
                <p>From a user perspective, Bitcoin is nothing more than a mobile app or computer program that provides

                    Bitcoin works for most users. </p>

                <p>Yes. There are a growing number of businesses and individuals using Bitcoin. This includes
                    brick-and-mortar
                    businesses like restaurants, apartments, and law firms, as well as popular online services such as
                    Namecheap
                    and Overstock.com. While Bitcoin remains a relatively new phenomenon, it is growing fast. As of May
                    2018,
                    the total value of all existing bitcoins exceeded 100 billion US dollars, with millions of dollars

                    or
                    PayPal payment, most exchanges do not allow funding via these payment methods. This is due to cases
                    where someone buys bitcoins with PayPal, and then reverses their half of the transaction. This is
                    commonly referred to as a chargeback.

                How difficult is it to make a Bitcoin payment?

            <div class="answers">
                <p>Bitcoin payments are easier to make than debit or credit card purchases, and can be received without
                    a merchant account. Payments are made from a wallet application, either on your computer or
                    smartphone,
                    by entering the recipient's address, the payment amount, and pressing send. To make it easier to
                    enter
                    a recipient's address, many wallets can obtain the address by scanning a QR code or touching two
                    phones
                    together with NFC technology. </p>

                Why do people trust Bitcoin?
            </label>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>Much of the trust in Bitcoin comes from the fact that it requires no trust at all. Bitcoin is fully
                    open-source and decentralized. This means that anyone has access to the entire source code at any
                    time.
                    Any developer in the world can therefore verify exactly how Bitcoin works. All transactions and
                    bitcoins
                    issued into existence can be transparently consulted in real-time by anyone. All payments can be
                    made
                    without reliance on a third party and the whole system is protected by heavily peer-reviewed
                    cryptographic
                    algorithms like those used for online banking. No organization or individual can control Bitcoin,
                    and the
                    network remains secure even if not all of its users can be trusted. </p>

                    finance crime. Bitcoin can bring significant innovation in payment systems and the benefits of

                <p>The Bitcoin protocol itself cannot be modified without the cooperation of nearly all its users,

                    rules of the global Bitcoin network is not a practical possibility. Any rich organization could
                    choose to invest in mining hardware to control half of the computing power of the network and
                    become able to block or reverse recent transactions. However, there is no guarantee that they
                    could retain this power since this requires to invest as much than all other miners in the world.

                    accrues regardless of the medium used. There is a wide variety of legislation in many different

            </label>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>Bitcoins have value because they are useful as a form of money. Bitcoin has the characteristic
                    s of money (durability, portability, fungibility, scarcity, divisibility, and recognizability)
                    based on the properties of mathematics rather than relying on physical properties (like gold and
                    silver)
                    or trust in central authorities (like fiat currencies). In short, Bitcoin is backed by mathematics.
                    With these attributes, all that is required for a form of money to hold value is trust and adoption.
                    In the case of Bitcoin, this can be measured by its growing base of users, merchants, and startups.
                    As with all currency, bitcoin's value comes only and directly from people willing to accept them as
                    payment. </p>

                Why do I have to wait for confirmation?
            </label>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>Receiving notification of a payment is almost instant with Bitcoin. However, there is a delay before
                    the network begins to confirm your transaction by including it in a block. A confirmation means that
                    there is a consensus on the network that the bitcoins you received haven't been sent to anyone else
                    and are considered your property. Once your transaction has been included in one block, it will
                    continue to be buried under every block after it, which will exponentially consolidate this
                    consensus
                    and decrease the risk of a reversed transaction. Each confirmation takes between a few seconds and
                    90
                    minutes, with 10 minutes being the average. If the transaction pays too low a fee or is otherwise
                    atypical, getting the first confirmation can take much longer. Every user is free to determine at
                    what point they consider a transaction sufficiently confirmed, but 6 confirmations is often
                    considered
                    to be as safe as waiting 6 months on a credit card transaction.

                What is Bitcoin mining?

            <div class="answers">
                <p>Mining is the process of spending computing power to process transactions, secure the network, and
                    keep everyone in the system synchronized together. It can be perceived like the Bitcoin data center
                    except that it has been designed to be fully decentralized with miners operating in all countries
                    and no individual having control over the network. This process is referred to as "mining" as an
                    analogy to gold mining because it is also a temporary mechanism used to issue new bitcoins.
                    Unlike gold mining, however, Bitcoin mining provides a reward in exchange for useful services
                    required to operate a secure payment network. Mining will still be required after the last
                    bitcoin is issued. </p>

            <div class="answers">
                <p>Anybody can become a Bitcoin miner by running software with specialized hardware. Mining software
                    listens for transactions broadcast through the peer-to-peer network and performs appropriate tasks
                    to process and confirm these transactions. Bitcoin miners perform this work because they can earn
                    transaction fees paid by users for faster transaction processing, and newly created bitcoins issued
                    into existence according to a fixed formula. </p>

            <div class="answers">
                <P>Spending energy to secure and operate a payment system is hardly a waste. Like any other payment
                    service,
                    the use of Bitcoin entails processing costs. Services necessary for the operation of currently
                    widespread
                    monetary systems, such as banks, credit cards, and armored vehicles, also use a lot of energy.
                    Although
                    unlike Bitcoin, their total energy consumption is not transparent and cannot be as easily measured.

            <div class="answers">
                <p>Mining creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that makes it very difficult for anyone to
                    consecutively add new blocks of transactions into the block chain. This protects the neutrality of
                    the
                    network by preventing any individual from gaining the power to block certain transactions. This also
                    prevents any individual from replacing parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends, which
                    could be used to defraud other users. Mining makes it exponentially more difficult to reverse a past
                    transaction by requiring the rewriting of all blocks following this transaction.</p>

                    Bitcoin's
                    most common vulnerability is in user error. Bitcoin wallet files that store the necessary private
                    keys can be accidentally deleted, lost or stolen. This is pretty similar to physical cash stored in
                    a

                which is a good indication that the concept is well designed. However, security flaws have been found
                and
                fixed over time in various software implementations. Like any other form of software, the security of
                Bitcoin
                software depends on the speed with which problems are found and fixed. The more such issues are
                discovered,
                the more Bitcoin is gaining maturity.
